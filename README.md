The source article, above, explains how to set up and run the RAG model. (I ran the RAG model using iPython (Jupyter Notebook). In addition to setting up the Python environment with the correct libraries, I had to download and run Ollama: https://ollama.com/

To change which files are uploaded into the RAG model, and to change the prompt, modify the last section of Component 4

To change the instructor prompt ("Instruction: You're an expert problem solver..."), modify the beginning part of Component 4
