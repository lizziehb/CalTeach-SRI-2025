Much like in the Wisconsin\\nTechnical College System example described above, that\\nmeans surveying students or collecting outcomes data\\nfrom employers.\\nThere are obvious limitations to surveying students\\nabout their workforce outcomes, but some data are\\nbetter than none and the data can improve with time.\\nMany specialized accreditors and the federal Perkins\\nprogram already require it, so colleges likely have a\\nbaseline from which to build out data collecting for\\nnon-degree programs.\\nColleges could require exit surveys, for example, as the\\nfinal task in the final course of a program. This\\napproach would also allow colleges to ask students for\\nprogram feedback and how the college could support\\nthem after graduation, including interest in stackability.\\nMott Community College\\xa0uses a software system to\\ntrack data related to employment for all non-credit\\nworkforce programs. Mott’s efforts-to-outcomes system\\nallows the college to send a monthly follow-up to\\ngraduates for up to one year after employment.\\nInformation about program graduates’ employers and\\ngraduates’ job titles, start dates, pay rates, and benefits\\nis collected.\\nA less targeted but worthwhile approach would be to ask\\nmarketing and communications offices to share\\noutcomes surveys via social media and outreach\\nchannels to solicit feedback from graduates. Most\\ncolleges have social media platforms, newsletters,\\nalumni associations, mailers, and community-based\\norganization partners, all of which can be used to\\ndistribute outcomes surveys.\\nColleges could also obtain student outcomes data\\ndirectly from employer partners. As described in New\\nModels\\xa0brief 1\\xa0and\\xa0brief 2, programs should be\\ncreated with substantial co-creation with local hiring\\nmanagers. While many employers will be reluctant to\\nshare data about starting salaries, placement rates, and\\nbenefits packages, it is worth asking for the information\\nin the spirit of continuous improvement.\\nColleges that partner with single employers for a\\ncustomized training program are especially well\\npositioned to include a data-sharing element in their\\ncontracts with these employers.\\xa0Mesa Community\\nCollege\\xa0and Boeing, for example, partnered for\\na\\xa0credit-bearing, week-long manufacturing boot\\ncamp\\xa0to address a concrete labor market need. Even\\nfor such a short program, Mesa was able to collect\\ncritical outcomes data that informed program\\nimprovement.\\nAdditionally, tools from private companies such as\\nLightcast\\'s\\xa0Alumni Pathways\\nProgram\\xa0and\\xa0partnership with the National\\nStudent Clearing House\\xa0have also helped\\ncommunity colleges\\xa0derive insights\\xa0to inform\\nprogram improvement, fundraising, marketing, and\\nother efforts.\\nEmployer Outcomes Data\\nColleges should ensure that student outcomes are\\naligned with the stated program goals, but they must\\nalso ensure that the program is leaving employers\\nsatisfied with graduates.\\nStates, systems, or colleges should institutionalize\\nemployer outcomes surveys the way\\xa0Wisconsin\\nTechnical College System\\xa0has—mirroring the way it\\ngathers student outcomes data described above. The\\nsurvey is conducted every four years and collects\\nhigh-level information such as employers\\' views of the\\n\"importance of local technical college\" and whether they\\nwould \"hire graduate again\" or \"recommend graduate to\\nTo learn more, please visit newamerica.org.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Skia/PDF m123 Google Docs Renderer', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '2024-02-13T18:51:17-05:00', 'source': 'BRIEF__How_to_Use_Data_to_Improve_Non-Degree_Workforce_Community_College_Programs.pdf', 'file_path': 'BRIEF__How_to_Use_Data_to_Improve_Non-Degree_Workforce_Community_College_Programs.pdf', 'total_pages': 9, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'BRIEF: How to Use Data to Improve Non-Degree Workforce Community College Programs', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-02-14T12:25:05-05:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20240214122505-05'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20240213185117-05'00'\", 'page': 6}, page_content='another employer.\" The survey obtains an impressive 40\\npercent response rate.

LMI is an\\numbrella term to describe all the data a college can\\nlearn about its local job market. LMI can be granular\\n(e.g., real-time data about the demand for\\nmanufacturing technicians in three zip codes) or general\\n(e.g., projected demand for nurses in a state or region).\\nNot all non-degree programs are short-term, and even if\\nthey are, the job market can rapidly change. Checking\\nboth outcome data and LMI when improving programs\\nis prudent.\\nLMI should augment, not replace, insights gleaned from\\nindustry advisory committees and other structures to\\ncollect feedback directly from employer partners. LMI\\ndata points include:\\n●\\nHow many positions are there in the region?\\n●\\nWhat are the job’s regional race, gender, and age\\ndemographics?\\n●\\nWhich jobs are growing or declining in demand?\\n●\\nWhat is the job’s automation susceptibility?\\n●\\nWhat specific knowledge, skills, and abilities are\\nin demand; what credentials are preferred; how\\nmany years of work experience are required;\\nwhat will the day-to-day work look like?\\n●\\nWhat are the job’s expected starting salaries and\\nexpected benefits?\\nData USA by Deloitte\\xa0is a collection of publicly\\navailable\\xa0LMI data\\xa0at the federal level. State workforce\\nagencies are\\xa0another source of LMI reports.\\nPopular private LMI vendors\\ninclude\\xa0Lightcast\\xa0(formerly Emsi Burning\\nGlass),\\xa0Chmura, and\\xa0LinkedIn Insights. These\\nvendors use methods like scraping real-time job\\npostings or salary data to derive insights about what\\nemployers seek, including in-demand skills, industry\\ncertifications, and years of experience, among other\\ndata.\\nSome colleges have reported that LMI is less relevant to\\njobs related to non-degree workforce training because\\nthose jobs may not be posted on public job boards.\\nHowever, we believe that keeping the limitations of LMI\\nin mind, it is worth investing in.\\nEconomic development organizations, chambers of\\ncommerce, industry trade associations,\\xa0regional\\neconomic research centers based at\\nuniversities, think tanks, and\\xa0states\\xa0can all be\\nsources of free or low-cost LMI. Each provider uses a\\nvariety of methods to develop LMI, ranging from\\neconomic analysis and modeling to surveys of local\\nemployers.\\nProgram Improvement\\nFeedback from Graduates\\nThe final data point for a strong improvement process is\\nlearning from the experiences of alumni. Beyond\\noutcomes surveys, colleges can make use of virtual or\\nin-person town halls, focus groups, alumni advisory\\ncommittees, or even conversations with graduates led\\nby faculty and staff.\\nThese relationships can help schools understand future\\neducation needs and alumni aspirations, which can help\\nthem understand how to make stackability a reality,\\nwhich is another component of our quality framework.\\nColleges could include alumni on industry advisory\\ncommittees or other standardized protocols used to\\nhear feedback on workforce programs.\\nSome colleges may have informal or formal alumni\\nassociations, but alumni associations are rarely used\\nstrategically for program improvement, especially for\\nnon-degree programs.

Traditional \\napproaches to employment services have proven successful for exceeding local performance \\nthresholds. Current and recent past success noted, fast evolving changes in the economy and \\nlabor markets have increased the need to focus more attention and resources on investing in \\nthe skills enhancements necessary for meeting industry demand. \\n \\nThe Great Recession of 2008 had an enormous impact on the way by which communities \\nnation-wide approach the development of human capital.  The Recession caused a substantial \\ndownsizing of the workforce.  That disruption, combined with exponentially advancing \\ntechnology, initiated the greatest shift in the development of human talent since the industrial \\nrevolution.  This shift was reflected in the reauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act of \\n1998 as the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 (WIOA).   \\n \\nThe advent of WIOA marked the beginning of a reinvigorated emphasis for workforce system \\nservices responsive to industry need as a balance to attention on job-seeker need.  This meant \\nthat while services remained focused on income eligible individuals, the type of training and \\nmethods to providing placement and upskilling were increasingly required to reflect economic \\nconditions and industry demand in the Local Workforce Area.  The legislation emphasizes the \\ndistribution of services that directly impact poverty with the goal of supporting local economies, \\nhence the required inclusion of labor market information and industry trends in Workforce \\nSystem Plans.   \\n \\nTo this end, the apprenticeship model has been touted by the US Department of Labor as a \\nmodern “earn-and-learn” model to address the needs of individuals and the local economy.  The \\nregistered apprenticeship model has proven effective in addressing high-demand workforce \\nneeds in high-impact industry sectors nationally and globally.  The model affords workers the \\nability to be employed full-time while concurrently attending 144 hours of training and education \\nper annum for the duration of the apprenticeship (which may last 2,000-10,000 hours).  This \\nmodel leverages skill development through on-the-job training with the enhanced productivity \\nand problem solving that comes with theoretical foundations.  \\n \\nPartners within the Ventura County Workforce System recognize the increased complexity in \\nthe delivery of services in this era and seek to find collaborative solutions that leverage all \\npartner resources including services provided though the One-stop (AJCC), Vocational \\nRehabilitation, Adult Education, youth program providers and economic development \\norganizations.   \\n \\nIn an effort to support and enhance the workforce systems in Ventura County and throughout \\nthe State, the EDC—in partnership with the California Stewardship Network and by the support \\nof the Morgan Family Foundation—has compiled this Report, outlining seven case studies and \\nfederal guidance on the integration of the registered apprenticeship model into the local \\nWorkforce System, with an emphasis on best practices for braiding funds and functions among \\nWIOA partners to scale the apprenticeship model. \\n \\n \\nFederal Guidance \\n \\nThe U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) issued guidance on the integration of registered \\napprenticeships into the WIOA workforce system at the regional and local level in early 2017.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2019', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2019', 'creationdate': '2019-12-02T08:33:07-08:00', 'source': 'EDC-Workforce-Systems-Best-Practices-Apprenticeships-2019.pdf', 'file_path': 'EDC-Workforce-Systems-Best-Practices-Apprenticeships-2019.pdf', 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': '', 'author': 'alex wright', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2020-03-26T11:01:09-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20200326110109-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20191202083307-08'00'\", 'page': 2}, page_content='2 \\n \\nAs a workforce development model, registered apprenticeships \\ncontribute directly to the successful achievement of performance \\nmetrics for WIOA programs.    \\n \\nA formal registered apprenticeship (RA) program consists of two \\nprimary elements, the RA sponsor and the related supplementary \\ninstruction (RSI).  The RA sponsor is the entity that approves the \\napprenticeship standards and submits initial paperwork and \\nprogress updates on the apprentice.  The RSI is the entity \\nproviding the 144 hours of theoretical training for the apprentices.   \\n \\nTraditional RA sponsors and RSI trainers are the employer, \\nhowever, in recent years non-profits, industry associations, and \\ncommunity colleges have began to fulfill the role of sponsor and \\ntrainer with fee-based or subsidized services through state grants.   \\n \\nThese entities are defined as intermediaries according to federal \\nguidance.  They are the eligible training provider (ETP, as defined \\nby WIOA) and conduct the administration of the RA program.  \\nThey must identify the RSI training partner if they are not \\nconducting the training themselves.  Intermediaries can be \\ncommunity-based organizations, industry organizations, or two- \\nand four- year post-secondary institutes.1 \\n \\nRA sponsors may be listed on the ETP List (ETPL), though the \\nmajority have not been engaged with the workforce system under \\nWIOA and will need to be introduced to the rules and regulations \\nby WDBs.  Per federal policy, it is the responsibility of each state \\nto notify existing sponsors of their eligibility to be on the ETPL.   \\n \\nWhen developing policy and procedures, states and Local \\nWorkforce Areas are encouraged by USDOL to minimize the \\nburden to the registered apprenticeship program to be on the \\nETPL or to leverage WIOA subsidies.  Registered apprenticeship \\nprograms are not subject to the same application and performance \\ninformation requirements or to a period of initial or continued \\neligibility as other providers given their extensive application and \\nvetting process to become an RA program sponsor with USDOL.2  \\n \\nThe USDOL identifies four options for operationalizing the registered apprenticeship model in \\nthe local workforce area: \\n \\nRA SPONSOR \\nRSI PROVIDER/ETP \\nEMPLOYER \\nEmployer  \\nEMPLOYER \\nIntermediary \\nJOINT APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING \\nUnion training center \\nINTERMEDIARY \\nIntermediary \\n \\n1 TEGL WIOA 13-16, January 12, 2017. \\n2 TEGL WIOA 13-16, January 12, 2017. \\nFunctions of Intermediary  \\n1.EMPLOYER IDENTIFIES \\nOCCUPATION IN NEED OF AN \\nAPPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. \\n2.INTERMEDIARY TAKES THIS \\nINFORMATION TO THE STATE USDOL \\nOFFICE OF APPRENTICESHIP FOR \\nAPPROVAL \\n3.INTERMEDIARY ASSISTS EMPLOYER \\nIN THE COMPLETION OF PAPERWORK \\nTHAT IDENTIFIES THE COMPETENCIES \\nTO BE LEARNED DURING THE OJT \\nAND THE CONTENT TO BE LEARNED \\nDURING THE 144HRS OF \\nTHEORETICAL INSTRUCTION (RSI) \\n4.

The following table articulates how the \\napprenticeship model contributes to successful performance outcomes for the Local Workforce \\nSystem. \\n \\nWIOA Metric \\n \\nRA Contribution \\nEmployment Rate in the 2nd \\nQuarter after Exit \\nApprenticeship is an “earn and learn” model offering employment \\nfrom day one. Registered apprenticeships vary in length but require a \\nminimum of 2000 hours (more than 2 months). \\nWhether or not the WIOA participant was an apprentice (i.e., \\nemployed) at the time of participation, Adults and Dislocated Workers \\nwill be included in this metric, and because Registered \\nApprenticeship (RA) is employment, it yields a positive outcome.   \\n(For Adults, in order to make the low income priority, enroll potential \\napprentices before they start their RA program.)  Exit can occur prior \\nto the completion of the RA program, once WIOA services are \\ncomplete, still yielding a positive outcome. \\nYouth Employment and \\nEducation Rate in the 2nd \\nQuarter after Exit \\nRA is employment and education combined, yielding a positive \\noutcome for this metric. Exit can occur prior to the completion of the \\nRA program, once WIOA services are complete, still yielding a \\npositive outcome. \\nEmployment Rate in the 4th \\nQuarter after Exit \\nAs long as the individual remains in a RA program (or completes their \\nprogram), they are employed, yielding a positive outcome.  Exit can \\noccur prior to the completion of the RA program, once WIOA services \\nare complete, still yielding a positive outcome. \\nYouth Employment and \\nEducation Rate in the 4th \\nQuarter after Exit \\nAs long as the individual remains in a RA program (or completes their \\nprogram), they are employed, yielding a positive outcome for this \\nmetric.  Exit can occur prior to the completion of the RA program, \\nonce WIOA services are complete, still yielding a positive outcome. \\nMedian Earnings—2nd \\nQuarter after Exit \\nRegistered apprenticeship programs have built-in earnings gains as \\nskill gains are achieved. \\nAs long as the individual remains in a RA program (or completes their \\nprogram), they are employed and earning a wage. Exit can occur \\nprior to the completion of the RA program, once WIOA services are \\ncomplete. \\nCredential Attainment \\nAll registered apprenticeships end in a nationally portable, employer \\nrecognized credential.   \\nA RA Completion Certificate is a recognized post-secondary \\ncredential under WIOA. ** Some RA programs also include interim \\ncredentials, which are also industry-recognized.

The addition of basic skills \\n(English and mathematics) into the program further promotes success in the workplace and \\npositive performance outcomes.  Pre-apprenticeship programs must have at least one RA \\npartner with which completers may continue as a registered apprentice in order to be eligible for \\nWIOA funding.  In other words, the pre-apprenticeship must be tailored to address a specific \\nneed of an RA competency.   \\n \\nThe model has been applied for Adult and Dislocated Workers, and more frequently in \\nsuccessful WIOA Youth programs.  Pre-apprenticeships can satisfy the requirements for work \\nexperience element for youth programs.3  Successful Youth models have been implemented by \\nnon-profit intermediaries who partner with K-12 districts and employers to connect students with \\ntechnical training, work readiness, career exploration, and employment. Pre-apprenticeship \\nprograms have also been successful in addressing hard to serve populations such as re-entry \\nindividuals and foster youth. \\n \\nBest Practices for Braiding Funds & Functions in the Workforce System \\nWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act funds for Adult and Dislocated Workers4 may be used \\nto subsidize the sponsorship activities or the related supplementary instruction. All providers of \\ntraining for RSI must be on the ETPL in order to leverage WIOA funds.  Pre-vocational services, \\nlanguage skills, and job readiness may be provided under WIOA to prepare participants to enter \\napprenticeship programs. WIOA funds can be used to fund pre-apprenticeship programs that \\nprovide basic skills, work experiences, and other support to help participants obtain the skills \\nneeded to be placed into an apprenticeship.5 The Employment and Training Administration \\n“strongly encourages the workforce system to use WIOA funding to support registered \\napprenticeships in (the following) ways…”6 \\n1. Individual Training Accounts: Individual Training Accounts (ITAs) can be used to fund \\nthe related classroom instruction component of an apprenticeship program, as long as \\nthe apprenticeship program or the education/training provider for the apprenticeship \\nprogram is on the Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL).  Under WIOA, all Registered \\nApprenticeship program sponsors are automatically eligible to be placed on the ETPL.   \\nWIOA participants can use ITA funds to pay for the cost of tuition, as well as fees, \\nbooks, equipment, and other training-related costs (consistent with the policies for ITAs \\nestablished by the local workforce board). ITA funds can be used in combination with on-\\nthe-job training funds to support WIOA participants in apprenticeship. \\n2. Contract Training: for eligible individuals, contract training monies can fund cohort-based \\nRSI training for new employees who are RAs or incumbent workers. (cohort training \\nworks well for standards in the Uniform Guidance) \\n3. Youth Occupational Skills Training (pre-apprenticeships) \\n4. Supportive Services (transportation, tools, uniform, books) \\n5. RA sponsors can be supported using custom training agreements: WIOA funds can be \\nused for customized training with the employer paying for a significant portion of the cost \\n \\n3 WIOA Section129(c)(2)(C)(ii) \\n4 WIOA Title 1b \\n5 Making ApprenticeshipUSA Work for the Public Workforce System: USING WORKFORCE FUNDS TO \\nSUPPORT APPRENTICESHIP \\n6 TEGL WIOA 13-16, 2017.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2019', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2019', 'creationdate': '2019-12-02T08:33:07-08:00', 'source': 'EDC-Workforce-Systems-Best-Practices-Apprenticeships-2019.pdf', 'file_path': 'EDC-Workforce-Systems-Best-Practices-Apprenticeships-2019.pdf', 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': '', 'author': 'alex wright', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2020-03-26T11:01:09-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20200326110109-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20191202083307-08'00'\", 'page': 6}, page_content='6 \\n \\nof the training, as determined by the local workforce board.  Customized training can be \\nused to support apprenticeship programs by meeting the special requirements of an \\nemployer or a group of employers. Customized training may be used for both job \\nseekers and current (incumbent) employees \\n6. OJT: subsidized wages up to 75% of total wages for a period of time (typically up to six \\nmonths), individuals may work at multiple sites, supported by contract not ITAs. \\nUnder WIOA, on-the-job training (OJT) contracts may be established with employers to \\nsupport the OJT component of Registered Apprenticeship programs.  While employer \\nOJT reimbursement rates were 50% under the Workforce Investment Act, Governors \\nand local boards may choose to provide reimbursement to employers of costs up to 75% \\nof apprentice wage rates under WIOA.  OJT may be used with both job seekers and \\ncurrent (incumbent) workers already employed by the business \\n7. Incumbent Worker Training: up to 20% of Title 1b funds may designated for incumbent \\nworker training enabling workers to remain on the job while in training. Under WIOA, \\nlocal areas may use up to 20% of their adult and dislocated worker funds, and states \\nmay use their statewide activities and rapid response funds, for incumbent worker \\ntraining.  Employers pay a portion of the cost. Apprenticeships are a good way to up-skill \\nentry-level employees, retain them, and provide workers with an upward career path.  \\nTherefore, incumbent worker training is an effective strategy to support apprenticeship \\nprograms. (strongly encouraged in WIOA) \\n \\nOther funding to support RAs may be accessed through Department of Education resources. \\nApprentices may be eligible for Federal Financial Aid under certain circumstances.  If the \\napprenticeship is connected to a post-secondary institution, apprentices may be eligible for Pell \\nGrants - $3,000 on average per apprentice to support tuition, books and lab fees.  Also, the \\npost-secondary institution may choose to provide federal work-study grants, which average \\n$2,000 per apprentice which may be applied to wages at an RA employer sponsor.7 \\n \\nCase Studies \\nThis report contains seven case studies on workforce systems throughout the nation that have \\nintegrated the registered apprenticeship model and/or non-profit collaborations that substantially \\nenhance the local workforce system.

Interest in apprenticeship programs \\nhas continued in the Trump administration.  \\nDuring this period, apprenticeships have \\nundergone a major transformation in the United \\nStates. Once regarded primarily as a means of \\ntraining for people pursuing blue collar, union \\njobs in the trades, the apprenticeship model is \\nnow more widely accepted as an innovative \\napproach to training for all kinds of jobs. \\nApprenticeships are beginning to be offered in a \\nvariety of industries for many types of \\noccupations, and work-based learning in general \\nis more widely recognized as a talent \\ndevelopment strategy that enables employers to \\ndevelop a skilled workforce while providing \\npeople with the expertise they need to advance \\nin their careers.  \\nDespite the recent evolution of apprenticeship \\nprograms, there have been concerns that not all \\nAmericans have equal access to apprenticeship \\nopportunities, and many workforce development \\nspecialists have recognized the need to find ways \\nto get women, people of color, and people with \\ndisabilities more engaged in this proven pathway \\nto middle class jobs and wages.

Businesses in \\na growing number of industries recognize that apprenticeship represents an effective alternative \\nto traditional approaches of attracting, preparing, and upskilling talent. And for workers, \\napprenticeship has been shown to be a viable pathway to higher-skilled jobs, increased earnings, \\nand longer-term job retention. With these benefits, apprenticeship programs are a promising \\napproach to promote diversity and equity within companies and throughout industries. \\nHowever, expanding apprenticeship into new sectors involves challenges, such as the need to \\novercome and change traditional perceptions of apprenticeship while also developing alternative \\nways to support the design and delivery of training programs, and promoting diversity and \\ninclusion for nontraditional and underrepresented populations. \\nJust as the promise of improved equity and inclusion has not been realized in the broader \\nworkforce, apprenticeship programs specifically have challenges with diversity: an \\noverwhelming majority of apprentices are white and male. Women, people of color, and \\nindividuals with disabilities have historically experienced challenges accessing and completing \\napprenticeship programs, particularly those in high-wage occupations and industries. \\nApprenticeship programs have much to offer businesses, workers, and the U.S. economy as a \\nwhole. They can contribute to the development of a stronger U.S. workforce, increase earnings, \\nprepare people for the jobs of the future, and help companies meet their ever-changing \\nworkforce needs. However, the current gender and racial composition of most apprenticeship \\nprograms does not reflect the demographic makeup of the U.S. workforce. \\nThis brief explores strategies that 22 leading companies and industry associations are using to \\nmake apprenticeship models more diverse and inclusive and, in turn, advance equity in their \\ncompanies and the communities they serve. Some of these strategies have been identified as best \\npractices by community-based organizations working with underrepresented populations and \\ntraining providers but have not yet gained widespread employer buy-in. The examples shared \\nhere serve as lessons illustrating how more businesses can apply these strategies in their \\napprenticeship programs to improve diversity and equity within their internal operations and \\nthroughout their industries. \\nEquity in Apprenticeship \\nDesigning and launching an apprenticeship program requires a lot of upfront planning, \\nincluding determining how a combination of on-the-job training and related technical \\ninstruction can prepare workers for critical jobs.

people with hard-to-find \\nskills. Businesses in a wide mix of industries, from \\nhealth care and information technology (IT) to \\nmanufacturing, insurance, and hospitality, are \\nreexamining apprenticeship. For many, this means \\nsetting up apprenticeship programs not only as a \\nway to build a talent pipeline, but also as a way to \\nimprove the diversity of their workforces.  \\nThe focus on designing and implementing \\napprenticeship programs to emphasize inclusivity \\nis important because women and people of color \\ngenerally have less access to, and realize fewer \\nbenefits from, apprenticeships than white men do. \\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Labor, women \\nrepresent almost half of the labor force but made \\nup just 8 percent of registered apprentices in 2018.2 \\nMeanwhile, although African Americans account \\nfor 13.4 percent of the U.S. population, just 10 \\npercent of the people who completed Registered \\nApprenticeship programs were African American.  \\nLimited participation is compounded by the \\noutcomes among those who do engage.  \\nIn Fiscal Year 2017, the median hourly wage of men who completed apprenticeships was $27.25. \\nFor women, who often apprentice in lower-wage and lower-skilled industries and occupations, it \\nwas $11.49. African Americans had the lowest median wage of people from all racial and ethnic \\ngroups who completed apprenticeships that year: $14.35 per hour. Other races and ethnicities \\nmore closely track overall participation rates and wage rates.3  \\nDespite outcomes like those, the apprenticeship model holds great promise as a way to connect \\npeople from underrepresented populations to jobs and careers that require highly sought-after \\nWhat is Apprenticeship? \\nApprenticeship is a workforce training model \\nthat combines paid on-the-job learning and \\nformal classroom instruction to help a worker \\nmaster the knowledge and skills needed for \\ncareer success. High-quality apprenticeships \\ntypically include supervision and mentoring, \\nalign with industry standards, and result in a \\nnationally recognized credential. \\nA Registered Apprenticeship is approved by \\neither the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of \\nApprenticeship or a state apprenticeship \\nagency. These programs last one to six years \\nand are sponsored by employers, labor \\nmanagement organizations, or other \\nintermediaries. In addition to the program \\nelements common across all quality \\napprenticeships, these programs meet several \\nrequirements, including providing \\napproximately 2,000 hours of on-the-job \\nlearning, 144 hours of related instruction, and \\nprogressively increasing wages.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Acrobat Pro DC 19.12.20034', 'creationdate': '2019-07-18T15:34:14-04:00', 'source': 'GrowingEquityandDiversitythroughApprenticeship-BizPerspectives-07182019-2.pdf', 'file_path': 'GrowingEquityandDiversitythroughApprenticeship-BizPerspectives-07182019-2.pdf', 'total_pages': 32, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2019-07-18T15:34:14-04:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20190718153414-04'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20190718153414-04'00'\", 'page': 10}, page_content='11\\nskills. Companies struggling to find and \\nretain talent are more willing to nurture \\ntalent within their own workforces, thereby \\nexpanding their hiring pools.  \\nThe apprenticeship model is particularly \\nbeneficial to people who are new to the \\nworkforce because it makes it more feasible \\nfor them to pursue training opportunities by \\nenabling them to earn money while they \\nlearn, instead of having to choose between \\nwork and school. Some apprentices are able \\nto earn credentials or degrees without \\nincurring student debt, a big plus given the \\nrising cost of college.4 \\nTo highlight promising strategies that \\norganizations are using to promote and \\nsupport diversity and equity in \\napprenticeship programs, JFF’s Center for \\nApprenticeship & Work-Based Learning \\nrecently conducted dozens of interviews with \\nbusiness leaders and convened a March 2019 \\nmeeting where representatives of 22 \\nemployers and industry associations from \\nvarious sectors engaged in a roundtable \\ndiscussion about ways to build equity in \\napprenticeships. CEOs, diversity officers, \\nhuman resources (HR) officers, and other \\nbusiness leaders responsible for overseeing apprenticeships provided insights into what it takes \\nto lead an effort to use apprenticeship as a strategy to recruit, advance, and retain diverse talent. \\n“Talent is everything. Through paid youth \\napprenticeship, we’re providing young people the \\nopportunity to develop critical skills in occupations \\nthat they choose. This gives business the talent they \\nneed to compete globally.”  \\nNoel Ginsburg, Founder and CEO, CareerWise Colorado \\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion \\nDefined \\nDiversity focuses on differentiating the \\npopulations that are represented in \\napprenticeship and the relevant industry, for \\nexample increasing the number of people of \\ncolor in apprenticeship programs that are \\npredominately white or increasing the number \\nof women in apprenticeships and industries \\nthat are largely male.  \\nEquity focuses on eliminating the practices \\nand/or processes that prevent the same high \\noutcomes, like retention and advancement, in \\nthe apprenticeship or relevant industry. This \\nincludes examining biases or cultural \\nassumptions that disadvantage people of \\ncolor, women, and others the in selection, \\nevaluation, and advancement process.  \\nInclusion is creating an environment that \\nensures that all individuals feel respected, \\ninvolved, connected, and valued in their \\ncompany, and where the employer \\ndemonstrates that it values all ideas, \\nbackgrounds, and perspectives.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Acrobat Pro DC 19.12.20034', 'creationdate': '2019-07-18T15:34:14-04:00', 'source': 'GrowingEquityandDiversitythroughApprenticeship-BizPerspectives-07182019-2.pdf', 'file_path': 'GrowingEquityandDiversitythroughApprenticeship-BizPerspectives-07182019-2.pdf', 'total_pages': 32, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2019-07-18T15:34:14-04:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20190718153414-04'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20190718153414-04'00'\", 'page': 11}, page_content='12 \\nThis brief synthesizes the strategies shared by representatives of leading businesses that are \\ndesigning and implementing apprenticeship programs to meet their skill needs while giving \\npeople from underserved populations pathways into solid middle-skill jobs. At each phase of \\nprogram design and delivery, they are endeavoring to use the apprenticeship model as a way to \\ntrain and advance talent not only to improve their competitiveness by addressing skills \\nshortages but also to build workforces whose demographic makeup reflects that of their \\ncustomer bases and the communities they serve.  \\nSome of these strategies have yet to be widely adopted among businesses even though they have \\nbeen identified as best practices by training providers and community-based organizations that \\nwork with underrepresented populations.  \\nSome companies are just getting started.

But companies recognize that it is \\nnot enough to simply create an opportunity to pursue an apprenticeship, because the playing \\nfield isn’t level and not everyone has the same degree of access. Businesses can improve their \\ntalent-development efforts by actively taking steps to make apprenticeship pathways more \\naccessible across every phase of program delivery. This includes embedding equity into all \\nelements of apprenticeship design, including recruitment and selection, preparation, training, \\nand post-apprenticeship efforts to ensure that journey-level workers who have completed the \\nprogram enjoy continued success. \\nThe ultimate goal of equitable apprenticeships is to find and train talented workers who perform \\ntheir jobs at high levels, are engaged and contributing employees, and continue to learn and be \\npromoted. Each of the sections that follow discusses ways in which leading businesses view a \\nspecific stage of apprenticeship programs, with an emphasis on the challenges they face and \\nsample strategies for success. \\nAdjust Recruitment and Selection Processes \\nBusinesses seeking a diverse group of talented applicants for apprenticeship programs recruit \\nwidely. They actively engage with new populations to promote apprenticeship as a pathway to \\nhigh-skill, well-paying jobs and careers, and to help people of all backgrounds see that they can \\nbe strong candidates for apprenticeship. To maximize the diversity of their apprentice cohorts, \\nbusinesses and industry associations are using inclusive messaging and forging partnerships to \\nwiden their outreach as they communicate the value of apprenticeships. They are also using \\ninnovative approaches to assessing and selecting candidates. \\nAttracting a diverse applicant pool. Businesses in a number of high-wage industry sectors, \\nsuch as IT and the building and construction trades, recognize that they have a reputation for \\npredominantly hiring white males, and many of them are anxious to rebut that perception and \\nshow prospective employees that their workplaces are accessible and welcoming.  \\nBut reaching people from other demographic groups is a challenge. People with disabilities may \\nsee their work options as limited. Young people may not know about job opportunities and \\nupward pathways in particular industries. Women may face barriers or otherwise be reluctant to \\nenter male-dominated fields like construction or IT.

Veterans may not know \\nhow to translate their military experience into the civilian job market.  \\nIn the face of such challenges, businesses are rethinking the design of the marketing materials \\nthey use in efforts to recruit women, people of color, and members of other underrepresented \\npopulations. “It’s extremely important to show diverse faces in marketing materials,” says \\nLonnie Coleman, CEO of Cleveland-based mechanical contracting company Coleman Spohn, \\nand a former apprentice himself. “How we present ourselves sends an important message to \\napprenticeship candidates and we want to say: ‘You can do this. This is about you.’” \\nEven with improved outreach materials, many companies are finding that traditional \\nrecruitment methods that rely on passively posting job openings online is not enough to attract \\napplicants from new populations. Organizations that run apprenticeship programs need to do \\nmore to attract candidates who may not otherwise be aware of the openings or may not see \\nthemselves as strong candidates for apprenticeships in certain lines of work. To widen their \\nrecruiting nets, many companies are partnering with local and national organizations that have \\nexperience engaging with and supporting underrepresented populations. Partners can include \\ncommunity-based organizations, local workforce boards, high schools, youth organizations, \\nnational nonprofits, unions, rehabilitation centers, city and county governments, veterans’ \\norganizations, the military, and community colleges and universities.  \\n“This is not charity. This is a bottom-line decision. \\nWe need to attract new candidates to our industry \\nand break down barriers that keep underrepresented \\npopulations out.

Much of their \\nsuccess depends on developing strong relationships and managing expectations. Apprenticeship \\nprograms generally last more than one year, so businesses need to have some insight into their \\npartners’ operations, including an understanding of how they are funded, the timelines they \\nfollow, and the performance outcomes they expect.

As one \\nof the participants in our roundtable discussion said, “When it doesn’t work, we should look at \\nourselves.” \\nUpdating perceptions of apprenticeships. Apprenticeships are often misunderstood. They \\nare typically associated only with the traditional trades, and aren’t seen as viable pathways into \\nmodern-day jobs and careers. Some companies that have heard the question “Isn’t \\napprenticeship a union thing?” are trying to change the narrative. Businesses across a wide \\nrange of industries are working to build awareness that the apprenticeship model is in fact a \\nmodern approach to training that works for many industries and career paths.  \\nBut even businesses that are expanding apprenticeship programs haven’t always done a good job \\nof letting jobseekers know that they value the apprenticeship experiences they may have had; in \\nfact, many companies typically don’t list apprenticeships among the qualifications they’re \\nseeking in potential applicants.  \\nThat is starting to change. Some companies now recognize that completing an apprenticeship is \\nevidence of proven competency and are specifying a preference for hiring people who have \\nparticipated in apprenticeship programs. With its apprenticeship program, The Hartford, is \\nrecruiting skilled claims professionals outside of the traditional college track. Apprentices, who \\nmust have a two-year degree, are guaranteed a full-time job at the national insurer upon \\ncompletion of the program’s college courses and on-the-job training. In North America, Zurich \\nInsurance is also beginning to accept apprenticeship as another credential in order to qualify \\nfor certain jobs.  \\nIt is also important to emphasize the value of apprenticeships when doing outreach to high \\nschools and colleges.

In an effort to attract recent graduates, some businesses also now align apprenticeship \\nstart dates with school calendars. \\nSuch approaches can pay off for companies that are focusing on diversity and inclusion. “With \\nyouth apprenticeship you get more diverse people out of high school and learn quickly that all \\nyouth can succeed,” said Noel Ginsburg, CEO of CareerWise Colorado, a statewide youth \\napprenticeship initiative that acts as an intermediary between businesses and K-12 school \\nsystems. “The earlier we start, the more inclusive we can be.” \\nCompetency-based assessment and selection of apprentices. Traditional selection \\ncriteria, such as formal degrees and years of previous experience, can exclude otherwise strong \\ncandidates with nontraditional backgrounds from consideration for participation in \\napprenticeship programs. Companies that recognize that competencies and skills are what \\nmatter are looking beyond traditional résumés for new ways to assess whether people have the \\ntraits and expertise they are looking for.  \\nTechtonic and Catalyte use an apprenticeship selection strategy that focuses on aptitude \\nrather than degree attainment or work experience. For its part, Catalyte uses artificial \\nintelligence to reduce bias in assessing who has the ability to be a software developer, regardless \\nof their previous education or work experience. Meanwhile, IBM sources its apprenticeship \\ncandidates from a diverse candidate pool, including veterans, P-TECH graduates, and people \\nwho are reentering the workforce. The company also has required bias training for candidates. \\nPrepare Candidates for Entry into Apprenticeship \\nWhen recruiting new talent, some companies find that pre-apprenticeship and other bridge \\nprograms that provide basic foundational training and an introduction to their industries can \\nhelp more potential candidates be ready for apprenticeship entry. Pre-apprenticeship \\nexperiences can not only make apprenticeship more accessible, they can also increase the \\nlikelihood that apprentices will successfully complete the training program and become full-time \\nemployees. This is particularly true for some populations. For example, in the construction \\nindustry, there is evidence that pre-apprenticeships can help low-income, minority, and female \\nworkers locate, navigate, and retain employment.5 For young people with no job experience, job-\\nreadiness programs can help them build supportive networks and prepare them to navigate \\ncareer options.6 \\nProviding job readiness and a basic understanding of the industry, terminology, \\nand job expectations.

These candidates \\nare also less likely to know how to navigate the application process for an apprenticeship or the \\nindustry itself. Such situations can be challenging because transitioning people into unfamiliar \\nenvironments can be difficult for both the apprentices and their peer workers. \\nPre-apprenticeship programs can help prepare would-be apprentices for such situations because \\nthey are designed to introduce people to the company and its expectations for employees, and \\ngive them an understanding of workplace culture, job roles, and industry norms. An additional \\nbenefit is that participants form relationships with their pre-apprenticeship peers, giving them a \\nsupport network to call on from day one. That can be particularly helpful for apprentices from \\nunderrepresented communities who will be stepping into industries whose workforces generally \\nhaven’t included people who look like them—when, say, a company recruits women apprentices \\nto work in a male-dominated industry, or people with disabilities get jobs at companies where \\nmost of the workers are able-bodied.  \\nHershey, the Pennsylvania-based chocolate company, partners with Wilson Workforce and \\nRehabilitation Center and the Shenandoah Valley Workforce Development Board to recruit \\npeople with disabilities and other graduates of a 16-week pre-apprenticeship program designed \\nto help participants master core manufacturing, warehouse, and employability skills. Hershey \\nprovides input on the curriculum but mostly trusts Wilson to provide a solid foundation of \\nknowledge that Hershey can build on. Once people complete the pre-apprenticeship program, \\nHershey considers them for its Industrial Manufacturing Technician apprenticeship.  \\nApprenticeship sponsors can also design and manage their own pre-apprenticeship programs. \\nFor example, North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) offers a 120-hour \\n(minimum) apprenticeship-readiness training program (ARP) that teaches the Building Trades’ \\nMulti-Craft Core Curriculum (MC3). The MC3 is recognized by affiliated local and national \\nunions. Participants in NABTU ARPs receive an introduction to the construction industry as \\nwell as academic and hands-on training in which they learn skills such as blueprint reading, tool \\nsafety, construction, math, and the life skills necessary for success in the construction industry. \\nLikewise, the Ironworkers union offers three-week, veterans- and women-only ARPs. \\nDesigned as a safe and encouraging introduction to the industry, the women-only program is \\ntaught by women and allows women to gain confidence before they enter job sites where they \\nmight be the only female apprentice. In Philadelphia, SPIN Inc., a provider of services for \\npeople with intellectual, developmental, and autism spectrum disabilities, recruits unskilled \\nyouth for its apprenticeship program and finds pre-apprenticeship to be absolutely essential. “It \\ngives our unskilled youth participants needed soft skills at a professional level,” says Lucy \\nCorker, director, professional development at SPIN.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Acrobat Pro DC 19.12.20034', 'creationdate': '2019-07-18T15:34:14-04:00', 'source': 'GrowingEquityandDiversitythroughApprenticeship-BizPerspectives-07182019-2.pdf', 'file_path': 'GrowingEquityandDiversitythroughApprenticeship-BizPerspectives-07182019-2.pdf', 'total_pages': 32, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2019-07-18T15:34:14-04:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20190718153414-04'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20190718153414-04'00'\", 'page': 17}, page_content='18\\nOther companies similarly note that young people with little or no job experience may not have \\nhad the opportunity to apply their academic knowledge in an industry setting and may not have \\nthe professional skills needed to navigate the workplace. One strategy to prepare them for the \\ntype of environment they will encounter on the job is to offer high school career and technical \\neducation programs that integrate academic and industry-specific learning. For example, the \\nNational Restaurant Association Educational Foundation (NRAEF) offers a two-year \\nprogram called ProStart that introduces students to the fundamentals of the restaurant industry, \\nfrom daily restaurant operations and menu management to food safety. “ProStart serves as a \\nkind of pre-apprenticeship program in that students gain key competencies and those who log \\n400 hours of on-the-job training earn advanced standing in a hospitality apprenticeship, giving \\nthem a real leg up on a career,” says John Shortt, the NRAEF’s director of program \\ndevelopment.  \\nIdentifying candidates who are a good fit for an apprenticeship. Apprenticeships are a \\nmajor investment for employers and apprentices alike. Companies do not always know for sure \\nthat incoming apprentices are truly committed to the job and the field. To address that \\nchallenge, several companies have designed their own prerequisite learning activities, often \\ncoursework completed online, as a way of testing not only a candidate’s aptitude for the job but \\nalso his or her interest in and commitment to the industry. Candidates who complete the pre-\\nwork are better prepared on day one and more likely to complete their apprenticeship. \\nFor example, Treehouse, an organization whose mission is to provide affordable technology \\neducation, accepts people as apprentices only after they complete a roughly six-month, self-\\npaced sequence of online courses. To help make this requirement less onerous, Treehouse \\nteamed up with Comcast, which provides candidates with laptops and internet connections. The \\ncompany also designed the coursework to be flexible, so students will be able to continue \\nworking at their current jobs, and it provides mentors who offer candidates guidance via the \\ninternet.  \\nMinimizing barriers for applicants. Many businesses find that pre-apprenticeship \\nprograms give them a larger pool of candidates who are prepared to jump into apprenticeships. \\nBut upfront requirements can also present barriers that cause potential applicants to pass up the \\nopportunity. For example, pre-apprenticeship is unnecessary for candidates who already have \\nthe right skills and experience; also, all candidates are expected to invest time and work without \\npay.  \\nEmployers that want to minimize such hurdles seek to strike a balance between having \\nsufficiently robust pre-training programs and screening processes, and keeping upfront \\nactivities as short and simple as possible. The goal is to fill jobs and develop productive workers'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Acrobat Pro DC 19.12.20034', 'creationdate': '2019-07-18T15:34:14-04:00', 'source': 'GrowingEquityandDiversitythroughApprenticeship-BizPerspectives-07182019-2.pdf', 'file_path': 'GrowingEquityandDiversitythroughApprenticeship-BizPerspectives-07182019-2.pdf', 'total_pages': 32, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2019-07-18T15:34:14-04:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20190718153414-04'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20190718153414-04'00'\", 'page': 18}, page_content='19\\nin a relatively short period of time, and one way to do that is to streamline pre-apprenticeships \\nand incorporate as much training as possible into the apprenticeship itself. \\nTo ensure that pre-apprenticeship programs are accessible, it’s important for companies to be \\nflexible about preliminary requirements and offer supports for candidates who find the \\nqualifying activities burdensome. For example, Treehouse provides a flexible structure that \\nallows candidates to complete pre-apprenticeship coursework on weekends or at night.  \\nPlan Flexible and Responsive Training \\nHigh-quality apprenticeships are often intense long-term programs. Not all participants \\ncomplete their apprenticeship: In the construction industry, for example, approximately half of \\nthe people who enroll in Registered Apprenticeship programs end up dropping out, and the \\ndropout rates are higher for women and people of color.7  \\nHigh dropout rates are costly for workers, who lose out on opportunities for career advancement \\nif they don’t finish their training, and for businesses, which invest in apprenticeships because \\nthey need people to move into hard-to-fill positions. Employers that want to reduce attrition \\nmay need to make adjustments to their programs. One step businesses can take to help ensure \\nthat their apprenticeship programs are designed and implemented in a way that gives \\nparticipants a good chance at success is to give one person responsibility for the organization’s \\napprenticeship and workforce development programs. \\nEnsuring that program design meets apprentices’ needs. Nontraditional candidates \\ncome with a range of skills and skill gaps. It can be difficult to design a single training program \\nthat accommodates people with a wide range of educational and job experiences. To ensure that \\neveryone is developing critical skills, employers must continually review the design of their \\napprenticeship programs. That may require modifying the curriculum, changing the schedule, or \\nredefining the program capstone experiences.  \\nLippert Components, a vehicle parts manufacturer in Indiana, made its apprenticeship \\nprogram more accessible to the approximately one-third of its workers who are Latinx by \\noffering a bilingual version of the related instruction. The company also offers free online classes \\nfor English language learners.

As technology evolves and job\\nrequirements change, employers face the challenge of finding\\nqualified workers to fill specialized roles. Apprenticeship programs\\nprovide a solution by offering a structured pathway for individuals to\\nacquire the specific skills needed in these industries.\\nThese programs not only benefit individuals seeking to enter the\\nworkforce but also contribute to the overall economic growth. By\\nproviding hands-on training and mentorship, apprenticeships\\nensure that workers are equipped with the necessary knowledge\\nand experience to excel in their chosen fields. This not only boosts\\nproductivity but also fosters innovation and competitiveness in the\\nindustry.\\nFurthermore, apprenticeships offer a practical alternative to\\ntraditional education. While a college degree is valuable, it may not\\nalways align with the practical skills required by employers.\\nApprenticeship programs bridge this gap by combining classroom\\ninstruction with on-the-job training, giving individuals the\\nopportunity to gain real-world experience while earning a wage.\\nBenefits of Building a Skilled Workforce through\\nApprenticeships\\nThere are numerous benefits to investing in apprenticeship\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 15.2 (Build 24C101) Quartz PDFContext', 'creator': 'Safari', 'creationdate': \"D:20250608203929Z00'00'\", 'source': 'How to Design Effective Apprenticeship Programs to Build a Skilled Workforce A Guide for Program Sponsors.pdf', 'file_path': 'How to Design Effective Apprenticeship Programs to Build a Skilled Workforce A Guide for Program Sponsors.pdf', 'total_pages': 10, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'How to Design Effective Apprenticeship Programs to Build a Skilled Workforce: A Guide for Program Sponsors', 'author': 'Edward Barnard', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': \"D:20250608203929Z00'00'\", 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250608203929Z00'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250608203929Z00'00'\", 'page': 3}, page_content='programs.
